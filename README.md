### Ghost Casper theme and SCSS

Basic Ghost Theme converted from Handlebar version to this Astro version. CSS Classes are the same but the styles have
been scoped to their respective components. It is in the process of being fully converted to SCSS.

## Ghost API Key

You will need to create a new integration in your Ghost backend and note the Ghost URL and Content API Key.

Then, for local developpement rename the `.env.test` to `.env` and fill it with the Ghost URL and API Key:

```
PUBLIC_GHOST_URL=https://astro-starter.digitalpress.blog

If you Deploy on Netlify, Vercel, etc you will have to set the same environement variables.
